1. Imports and Libraries
The script imports a wide range of libraries, including:

customtkinter: Likely used for creating a custom user interface (UI).
subprocess, platform, socket, psutil: Utilized for system and network information retrieval.
webbrowser, ctypes, os: Used for interacting with the operating system and external resources.
cryptography.fernet: Indicates encryption or decryption functionality.
win32api: Windows-specific API interactions.
tkinter: The standard Python GUI toolkit, used alongside customtkinter.
watchdog: Used for monitoring file system events.
collections.deque: For managing data collections.
2. System Information Functions
The script defines functions like get_system_info() and get_cpu_usage() to retrieve and return system details:

get_system_info(): Returns system details like OS type, node name, version, machine architecture, processor, and IPv4 address.
get_cpu_usage(): Returns CPU usage percentage and the number of logical cores.
3. GUI Setup and Interaction
The presence of customtkinter, tkinter, and simpledialog indicates that the script likely includes a graphical user interface. The GUI may be used to interact with users, display system information, and possibly take action based on user inputs.

4. File System Monitoring
The inclusion of watchdog libraries suggests that the script monitors changes in the file system. This is typically used to trigger actions when files are created, modified, or deleted in specified directories.

5. Encryption and Security
The script imports Fernet from the cryptography library, which suggests that there is encryption or decryption functionality present. This could be used to protect data or communications within the script.

6. Potential OS-Specific Operations
The usage of win32api and ctypes hints that the script might perform operations specific to the Windows operating
